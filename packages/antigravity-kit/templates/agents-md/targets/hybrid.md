### Hybrid Runtime (Antigravity + OpenCode)

- Antigravity surfaces remain active: `GEMINI.md`, `.gemini/rules/`, `.agent/workflows/`, `.agent/agents/`.
- OpenCode surfaces remain active: root `AGENTS.md` and `.opencode/commands/`.

### Operational Notes

- Keep workflow logic in SSOT templates (`templates/workflows/*.md`).
- Treat OpenCode commands as adapters generated from workflow SSOT.
- Ensure rule consistency across both surfaces before release.
