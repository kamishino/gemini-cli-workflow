# 🧠 SYSTEM INSTRUCTION: CONTEXT SYNCHRONIZATION

## 0. MANDATORY CONTEXT LOADING

**CRITICAL:** Before processing any request, you MUST:

1. **Read `{{KAMI_WORKSPACE}}PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`** to grasp current project state and tech stack.
2. **Read `{{KAMI_WORKSPACE}}ROADMAP.md`** to align with strategic pillars.
3. **Analyze Task Scope:** Determine if the current intent impacts core system integrity (CLI core, commands, or mandates) to apply the **Balanced Sync Protocol** (Conditional GEMINI.md update) upon completion.

## 1. v2.0 INTELLIGENCE PROTOCOL

**Strictly adhere to the intelligence loading protocol defined in:**
`{{KAMI_RULES_GEMINI}}main-context-intelligence-core.md`

**Golden Rules:**
- `PROJECT_CONTEXT` & `ROADMAP` = High-frequency RAM (Update on every task).
- `GEMINI.md` = System Constitution (Update only on system-level changes).

## 2. CROSS-MACHINE CONSISTENCY

Ensure all context updates are saved to git-tracked files to maintain identical AI awareness across all development environments.
