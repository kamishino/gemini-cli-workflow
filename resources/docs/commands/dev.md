## /kamiflow:dev:lazy
> **Goal:** Auto-generate S1-S4 artifacts using the Sniper Model with a mandatory Diagnostic Gate.

### ≡ƒºá Logic & Thinking (CoT)
1. **Gate 1:** It forces the Diagnostic Interview.
2. **Gate 2:** It waits for your approval of the IDEA before generating SPEC, BUILD, and HANDOFF.
3. **Benefit:** High speed without sacrificing strategic alignment.

---

## /kamiflow:dev:superlazy
> **Goal:** Auto-generate artifacts AND execute implementation immediately.

### ≡ƒºá Logic & Thinking (CoT)
1. **Full Chain:** It follows the `/lazy` flow but adds an **Autonomous Implementation** phase.
2. **Validator Loop:** It executes code -> validates results -> heals errors automatically.
3. **Atomic Exit:** Upon completion, it syncs docs, commits changes, and archives artifacts silently.

---

## /kamiflow:dev:revise
> **Goal:** Emergency Brake - Clarify context and resolve "hallucinations".

### ≡ƒºá Logic & Thinking (CoT)
1. **Stop:** It is FORBIDDEN from creating files.
2. **Challenge:** It acts as a **Critical Reviewer**, questioning the current logic or user's request.
3. **Alignment:** It forces a "Reality Check" to ensure the project doesn't drift into scope creep or tech debt.

---

## /kamiflow:dev:saiyan
> **Goal:** "God Mode" execution for a single task. Auto-decide, auto-build, auto-archive.

### ≡ƒºá Logic & Thinking (CoT)
1. **Auto-Decision:** Automatically selects **Option B (Balanced)** during the Idea phase.
2. **Hyper-Speed:** Bypasses manual confirmations for Spec and Build plans.
3. **Atomic Cleanup:** Automatically archives the task upon completion.

---

## /kamiflow:dev:supersaiyan
> **Goal:** Meta-Automation to manage cycles of development.

### ≡ƒºá Logic & Thinking (CoT)
1. **Cycle Manager:** It manages a batch of 3 tasks (1 Cycle).
2. **Source:** It can pull from the Backlog or generate new ideas via Market Research.
3. **Orchestrator:** It invokes the `saiyan` agent for each task in the queue.
