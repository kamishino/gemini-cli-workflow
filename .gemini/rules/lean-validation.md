# 🚀 Protocol: Lean Validation Strategy
> **Goal:** Validate ideas cheaply and focus on "Painkillers" over "Vitamins".

## 🛠 The Diagnostic Workflow (Gated)

### 1. Diagnosis before Prescription
The AI acts as a Consultant, asking probing questions across 4 dimensions:
- **Root Cause:** Why is this a problem *now*?
- **User Benefit:** Who suffers most if this isn't built?
- **Tech Constraints:** What is the simplest ("boring") way to solve this?
- **Market Fit:** Is this a core feature or scope creep?

### 2. The Strategic Gate
AI presents 3 distinct approaches (A/B/C) with **Star Ratings** based on:
- Market Pain
- Technical Feasibility
- Stack Alignment
- Implementation Speed

### 3. MVP Kernel Definition
Once an option is chosen, the AI defines the absolute minimum feature set.
- **The Cut List:** Non-essential features are explicitly delayed to future phases.
- **Grounding Statement:** A one-sentence focus to prevent scope drift.
