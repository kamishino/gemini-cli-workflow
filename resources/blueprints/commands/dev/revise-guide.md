# 📖 Revise Guide: Emergency Brake Protocol

## 1. Situation Analysis
- **Context Alignment:** Cross-check against `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` and `ROADMAP.md`.
- **Logic Gaps:** Identify missing steps, edge cases, or unverified assumptions.
- **Scope Boundary:** Detect creep not present in Growth Levers or MVP.

## 2. Diagnostic Questioning
Ask deep questions in 4 domains:
- **Purpose:** How does this advance ROADMAP goals?
- **Technical:** Is the tech stack usage correct?
- **Strategic:** Does it close a competitor gap?
- **Risk:** What is the biggest unverified assumption?

## 3. Error Recovery Integration
- **Hallucination:** Re-verify all file/function anchors via Phase 0.5.
- **Scope Creep:** Decide to break task, simplify, or continue.
- **Validation Failure:** Analyze logs, adjust criteria, or investigate manually.

## 4. Fresh S1-IDEA (Recovery Mode)
Include "Revision Context" section:
- Original Task ID and Error Report path.
- Lessons from previous attempt.
- Verified assumptions and Adjusted approach.

## 5. Historical Learning
Search ROADMAP achievements for similar tasks. Apply past success factors and avoid documented pitfalls.
