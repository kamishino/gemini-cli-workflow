# 🚀 Protocol: Lean Validation Strategy (KamiFlow)
> **Goal:** Validate ideas cheaply. Prevent scope creep. Focus on "Painkillers".

## 🛠 Workflow

### 1. Capture Idea (`/kamiflow:input`)
- **Goal:** Get the idea out of your head without judgment.
- **Action:** Simply type your raw thought. The AI will summarize it.

### 2. Verify Idea (`/kamiflow:verify`)
- **Goal:** The "3-Point Check" (Pain, Effort, Stack).
- **Rule:** If it's a "Vitamin" (nice-to-have), kill it. We only build "Painkillers".
- **Output:** `GO` or `NO GO`.

### 3. Define Kernel (`/kamiflow:mvp`)
- **Goal:** Define the absolute minimum feature set.
- **Action:** Create a "Cut List" of features to DELAY.
- **Output:** The "Grounding Statement" to keep you focused.
