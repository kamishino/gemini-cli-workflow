## Agent Configuration

Agents are defined as Markdown files in `.agent/agents/` with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml

description: What this agent does
triggers: [keyword1, keyword2]
owns: [src/**]
skills: [skill-name]

```

## How to Add Agents

```bash
# Scaffold a new agent
agk scaffold agent "My Agent" "Description"

# Find community agents
agk agents find react

# Re-register all agents
agk agents
```

## Skills

Agents can declare required skills via the `skills` field.
Install skills with `agk skills add <name>` from [skills.sh](https://skills.sh).
