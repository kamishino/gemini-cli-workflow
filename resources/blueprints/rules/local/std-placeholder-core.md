# 📜 Rule: Infrastructure Placeholder Standard (Dogfooding)

> **Goal:** Ensure all KamiFlow blueprints are environment-agnostic by using standardized tokens.

---

## 1. 🛑 NON-NEGOTIABLES

- **NO Anchored Paths:** Never use hardcoded strings like `./.gemini/rules/` or `{{KAMI_WORKSPACE}}` inside Blueprints.
- **Token Usage:** Always use the approved infrastructure tokens.
- **Transparency:** Use tokens that clearly identify the target infrastructure (Gemini vs KamiFlow).

## 2. 🧩 TOKEN MAPPING

| Physical Path        | Standard Token          | Use Case                                 |
| :------------------- | :---------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| `./.gemini/rules/`   | `{{KAMI_RULES_GEMINI}}` | Rules, Cross-references, AI directives.  |
| `{{KAMI_WORKSPACE}}` | `{{KAMI_WORKSPACE}}`    | Tasks, Archives, Roadmap, Context files. |

## 3. 🏗️ EXAMPLES

### ❌ WRONG (Anchored Path)

`Follow instructions in @./.gemini/rules/std-id-core.md`
`Update file at {{KAMI_WORKSPACE}}PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`

### ✅ CORRECT (Standard Tokens)

`Follow instructions in {{KAMI_RULES_GEMINI}}std-id-core.md`
`Update file at {{KAMI_WORKSPACE}}PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`

---

## 4. 🛡️ SOFT-STRICT ENFORCEMENT

While this rule is "Soft Strict" (AI makes mistakes), consistently ignoring it will lead to path corruption and build failures. If you see a raw anchored path, proactively refactor it to use the appropriate Token.

**Status:** Dogfooding Active ✅
