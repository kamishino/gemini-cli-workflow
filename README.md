Diagnostic interview and synthesis into 3 refined solution approaches.

### Step 2: /kamiflow:spec (The Specification Architect)

Detailed specification using Schema-First design and Context Anchoring.

### Step 3: /kamiflow:build (The Build Architect)

Break down SPEC into executable tasks with Legacy Code awareness.

## 🧠 The "Brain" Structure

- **`.gemini/rules/`**: The Constitution.
  - `manifesto.md`: Non-negotiable mindset (e.g., "No files > 300 lines").
  - `validator-loop.md`: Self-healing protocols.
  - `id-protocol.md`: Global ID tracking rules.
- **`.gemini/commands/kamiflow/`**:
  - `lazy.toml` & `superlazy.toml`: Auto-pilot modes for high-speed building.

## 🤝 IDE Integration (The Bridge)

KamiFlow is designed to work seamlessly alongside your IDE.

1.  **Plan in Terminal:** Use Gemini CLI for strategic planning.
2.  **Code in IDE:** Use `/kamiflow:bridge` to get the prompt and execute.
3.  **Sync Back:** After coding, run `/kamiflow:sync` to update AI memory.
