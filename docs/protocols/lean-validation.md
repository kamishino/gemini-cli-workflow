# 🚀 Protocol: Lean Validation Strategy (KamiFlow)
> **Goal:** Validate ideas cheaply. Prevent scope creep. Focus on "Painkillers".

## 🛠 The Diagnostic Workflow (Gated Sniper)

### 1. Capture & Interview (Phase 1: The Consultant)
- **Goal:** Diagnose the root cause and identify the user pain.
- **Action:** The AI asks 3-5 probing questions.
- **Rule:** Diagnosis before prescription. MANDATORY for all modes, including Lazy/SuperLazy.

### 2. Verify & Synthesize (Phase 2: The Chef)
- **Goal:** Create 3 distinct approaches with a mandatory **Situation & Root Pain** summary.
- **Output:** S1-IDEA (DRAFT).
- **The Gate:** AI must STOP and wait for user approval of the Situation and Option (A/B/C) before proceeding to SPEC/BUILD.

### 3. Define Kernel (S1-IDEA)
- **Goal:** Define the absolute minimum feature set (MVP).
- **Action:** Create a "Cut List" of features to DELAY.
- **Output:** The "Grounding Statement" to keep you focused.

## 🚀 Automated Modes (Gated Enforcement)
Even in `/lazy` or `/superlazy` modes, the AI is FORBIDDEN from generating secondary artifacts (SPEC, BUILD, HANDOFF) until the IDEA phase is explicitly approved. This ensures strategic alignment before execution.
