## 🚀 Quick Start (Choose Your Path)

### Option 0: CLI Manager (Premium - Recommended)

**Global installation for professional developers:**

```bash
# Install once globally
npm install -g gemini-cli-kamiflow

# Use in any project
cd your-project
kami init

# Or
gemini-cli-kamiflow init
```

**What it does:**

- ✅ One-time global installation on your machine
- ✅ Single command setup for any project
- ✅ Automatic updates for all linked projects
- ✅ Built-in health checks (`kami doctor`)
- ✅ Cross-platform (Node.js)

**See:** [Full CLI Manager Guide](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md#-method-0-cli-manager-detailed)

---

### Option A: Integrate into Existing Project (Multi-Project)

Use KamiFlow as a **Git Submodule** for auto-updates and clean separation:

```bash
# Add KamiFlow as a submodule
git submodule add https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gemini-cli-workflow.git .kami-flow
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Start Gemini CLI
gemini

# Wake and bootstrap
/kamiflow:wake
/kamiflow:bootstrap
/kamiflow:wake
```

**Result:** Portal network activated. KamiFlow operates at root via symbolic links.

---

### Option B: Use as Template (Clone)

Clone KamiFlow directly for a standalone copy:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gemini-cli-workflow.git my-project
cd my-project

# Start Gemini CLI
gemini
/kamiflow:wake
```

**Result:** Full KamiFlow copy ready to customize.

## 🧠 The "Brain" Structure

- **`.gemini/rules/`**: The Constitution.
  - `manifesto.md`: Non-negotiable mindset (e.g., "No files > 300 lines").
  - `validator-loop.md`: Self-healing protocols.
  - `id-protocol.md`: Global ID tracking rules.
- **`.gemini/commands/kamiflow/`**:
  - `lazy.toml` & `superlazy.toml`: Auto-pilot modes for high-speed building.

---

## 🤝 IDE Integration (The Bridge)

KamiFlow is designed to work seamlessly alongside your IDE.

1.  **Plan in Terminal:** Use Gemini CLI for strategic planning.
2.  **Code in IDE:** Use `/kamiflow:bridge` to get the prompt and execute.
3.  **Sync Back:** After coding, run `/kamiflow:sync` to update AI memory.
