description: KamiFlow Sniper Model - Full idea-to-ship workflow (S1→S4→Validate→Reflect→Sync→Commit)
---

# /kamiflow — KamiFlow Sniper Model Workflow

This workflow implements the KamiFlow Sniper Model for AntiGravity IDE — transforming a raw idea into deployed code through a structured pipeline.

> **Non-KamiFlow projects:** Use `/develop` instead — it's the portable version of this workflow without `.kamiflow/` dependencies.

## Runtime Notes

{{TARGET_OVERLAY}}

{{MODEL_OVERLAY}}

**Intent triggers** — This workflow activates when you say things like:

- "Run kamiflow mode"
- "Use the sniper workflow"
- "Execute the full KamiFlow pipeline"
- "Do the full idea-to-ship ceremony"

## When to Use

- Projects already using `.kamiflow/` artifacts and lifecycle.
- High-risk, multi-phase initiatives needing strict gates.
- Teams that want explicit planning artifacts before execution.

## References

Read these KamiFlow rules before executing (they are already loaded as global rules):

- `.gemini/rules/flow-factory-line-core.md` — The Factory Line Protocol (S1→S3)
- `.gemini/rules/flow-execution-core.md` — Execute → Validate → Heal → Report
- `.gemini/rules/flow-validation-core.md` — 3-Phase Validation
- `.gemini/rules/flow-reflection-core.md` — Strategic Reflection + Quality Gate
- `.gemini/rules/flow-checkpoint-core.md` — Checkpoint Protocol
- `.kamiflow/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` — Project state and active context

## 🔁 Phase 0: AUTO-WAKE — Session Context Restore

// turbo

> **This phase runs AUTOMATICALLY. Do not skip it.**

1. **Read all memory files** (silent):
   - `.memory/context.md` — current project state
   - `.memory/decisions.md` — last 5 decisions
   - `.memory/patterns.md` — established conventions
   - `.kamiflow/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` — KamiFlow project state
   - `ROADMAP.md` — strategic direction

2. **Show session banner:**

   ```
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   🔁 SESSION RESTORED
   📍 Last task:   [from context.md]
   ✅ Done:        [completed items]
   🔄 In progress: [started but not finished]
   ⏭  Next up:     [planned next]
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   ```

3. **Fast Track Classification** — Evaluate the user's request against 5 criteria:
   - Single file affected?
   - < 50 lines of change?
   - No API/schema changes?
   - No security implications?
   - No cross-module dependencies?

   **Decision:**
   - 🟢 ALL 5 = YES -> **Use `/quick-fix` workflow instead** (Fast Track)
   - 🟡 3-4 = YES -> Standard Mode (full Sniper Model)
   - 🔴 0-2 = YES -> Critical Mode (full ceremony + mandatory approval at each gate)

4. **Quick Health Check** (Optional but recommended):
   - Run `kamiflow dashboard` to see project health at a glance
   - Run `kamiflow hooks status` to verify git hooks are active
   - If this is a first session, suggest `kamiflow tour` for onboarding

## Phase 1: S1-IDEA (PLANNING Mode)

**Role:** Consultant & Critical Chef

5. **Diagnostic Interview (The Consultant)**
   - Analyze user request for ambiguity.
   - Ask 3-5 probing questions (Root Cause, User Benefit, Tech Constraints, Market Fit).
   - **STOP & WAIT** for user answers before proceeding definition.

6. **Synthesis Engine (The Chef)**

   **A. Historical Reference Check:**
   - Scan `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` (Legacy Knowledge) and `archive/` for similar past tasks.
   - Synthesize findings into "Diagnostic Insights".

   **B. Generate 3 Refined Options:**
   - **Option A (Safe & Fast):** MVP-first, minimal complexity. **NO** "Could Have" features.
   - **Option B (Balanced):** Recommended trade-off. ⭐
   - **Option C (Ambitious):** Full-featured, higher complexity.

   **C. MoSCoW Classification:**
   - Classify _all_ features in _each_ option as **Must/Should/Could/Won't Have**.

   **D. Weighted Scoring Matrix (1-5⭐):**
   - **Market Pain:** +1 per "Must Have" (Max 5).
   - **Technical Feasibility:** Start 5. -1 per new lib/legacy touch/high complexity.
   - **Stack Alignment:** 5 if standard. -2 if new lang/framework.
   - **Profit Potential:** (Market Pain + Feasibility) / 2.

7. **🚦 STRATEGIC GATE — MANDATORY STOP**
   - Present the 3 Options with Scores and MoSCoW breakdown.
   - **WAIT for user to select an option (A/B/C)**.
   - Do NOT proceed until user explicitly approves.
   - Save as `S1-IDEA` artifact in `.kamiflow/tasks/` including the **Assumption Verification Report**.

---

## Phase 2: S2-SPEC (PLANNING Mode)

**Role:** Specification Architect
**Key Lock:** Schema-First (Lock 2: define data models BEFORE logic)

8. **Schema-First Design** — Define all data models, interfaces, schemas, and type definitions before any business logic.

9. **Technical Blueprint** — Document:
   - User Stories
   - API Signatures / Function Interfaces
   - Edge Cases and Error Handling
   - Integration Points

10. Save as `S2-SPEC` artifact in `.kamiflow/tasks/`.

---

## Phase 3: S3-BUILD (PLANNING Mode)

**Role:** Senior Tech Lead
**Key Lock:** Legacy Awareness (Lock 3: search codebase before making changes)

11. **Reconnaissance** — Search the codebase for existing files, functions, and patterns that relate to the planned changes. Log findings.

12. **Task Breakdown** — Create atomic, executable task list with:
    - Specific file paths and anchor points (function names, line numbers)
    - TDD strategy (write tests first for high-risk changes)
    - Dependency order

13. Save as `S3-BUILD` artifact in `.kamiflow/tasks/`.

14. **Present the BUILD plan to user for approval before executing.**

---

## Phase 4: Execute (EXECUTION Mode)

15. Implement code changes following the S3-BUILD plan task by task.

16. For high-risk changes: Write test FIRST, verify it FAILS, then implement the fix.

17. After each major subtask, run available validation:
    - TypeScript: `tsc --noEmit`
    - Node.js: `npm run lint` or project-specific scripts
    - Run tests: `npm test` or equivalent

---

## Phase 5: Validate (VERIFICATION Mode)

18. **Phase A — Syntax (BLOCKING):** Run lint, type check, TOML validation.

19. **Phase B — Functional (BLOCKING):** Run unit/integration tests.

20. **Phase C — Traceability:** Verify S2-SPEC requirements coverage (>70%).

21. **Self-Healing:** If errors found, analyze -> fix -> retry (max 3x). Escalate to user if self-healing fails.

22. **Performance Validation** (if code changes affect CLI):
    - Run `kamiflow perf --compare` to check for regressions
    - If any benchmark > 10% slower, investigate before proceeding
    - See `bench-and-validate` skill for decision matrix

---

## Phase 6: Reflect

23. **Pre-Exit Quality Gate** — Verify ALL pass:
    - [ ] Tests pass
    - [ ] No lint errors
    - [ ] Documentation updated
    - [ ] No unaddressed TODOs
    - [ ] Git status clean

24. **Strategic Reflection** — Document:
    - Value Delivered (1-sentence impact)
    - Technical Debt Assessment (None/Minor/Significant)
    - Lessons Learned
    - Follow-up Tasks

---

## Phase 7: Sync & Unified Commit

25. Update `.kamiflow/ROADMAP.md` with completed items.

26. Update `.kamiflow/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` with session intelligence.

// turbo

27. Run `npm run sync-all` to build and sync all artifacts.

28. Stage all changes and create a unified commit with a descriptive message following the convention:

    ```
    feat|fix|chore(scope): description

    Task-ID: [NNN]
    ```

29. Archive completed task artifacts to `.kamiflow/archive/`.
